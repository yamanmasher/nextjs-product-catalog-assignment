# Next.js Product Catalog App

Welcome to the Next.js Product Catalog App assignment! This project aims to assess your abilities in developing a Next.js application that fetches data from an API, utilizes React hooks, writes clean TypeScript code, and integrates Material-UI for UI components.

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will create a product catalog application that fetches product data from a dummy API and displays it using Material-UI components. The application should have the following features:

- **Product Catalog Page:** Implement a page that displays a list of products fetched from the dummy API. Each product card should show the product name, price, image, and description.

- **Product Detail Page:** Implement a page that shows detailed information about a selected product. Clicking on a product card on the catalog page should navigate to this detail page. Display the product name, price, image, and description on this page.

## Requirements

- Fetch the product data from the provided dummy API endpoints:
    - Product catalog: `https://dummyapi.online/api/products`
    - Product detail: `https://dummyapi.online/api/products/{product_id}`

- Utilize React hooks, to manage the application state and handle data fetching.

- Write clean and modular code using TypeScript and proper separation of concerns.

- Implement error handling in case the API requests fail or return error responses.
